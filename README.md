## TOKENIZER.C <br/>

The program is used to separate strings into different tokens to characterize each string entered by the user. The program uses a Finite State Machine to follow the order in which the strings are entered in order to allocate their space in the memory and separately store them in another string variable to be printed to the user. FSM or Finite State Machine or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computations to have a better perspective of the program to be written. The program uses the tokens and prints their format first and then the token (Note: escape characters in the program are printed as hex values and other symbols with their name in English). The format for each token printed out is in caps to make it more visible to the user.
